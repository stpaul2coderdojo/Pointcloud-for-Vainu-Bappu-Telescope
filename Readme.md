suggest a good photometry tool for point cloud using VSLAM from a telescope camera for telescope images and a point cloud of the night sky

For photogrammetry with VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) from telescope images and generating a point cloud of the night sky, one tool that could be suitable is OpenSfM.

OpenSfM is an open-source photogrammetry library that can reconstruct 3D structures from 2D images using SfM (Structure from Motion) techniques. It is designed to work with large-scale datasets and can handle images from different sources, including drone cameras, smartphone cameras, and telescope cameras.

OpenSfM has support for VSLAM and can also generate point clouds from the reconstructed 3D structure. It has a command-line interface and a Python API, making it suitable for both standalone use and integration into larger workflows.

Here's an example of how you could use OpenSfM to generate a point cloud from telescope images:

    Install OpenSfM using pip:

pip install opensfm

    Collect a set of images from the telescope camera. It's best to use high-resolution images with minimal distortion and lens aberrations.

    Create a configuration file for OpenSfM that specifies the camera model, feature extraction parameters, and other options. You can use the default configuration or modify it to fit your specific use case.

    Run OpenSfM on the images using the following command:

bash

opensfm extract_metadata path/to/images
opensfm detect_features path/to/images
opensfm match_features path/to/images
opensfm create_tracks
opensfm reconstruct
opensfm mesh
opensfm undistort path/to/images

    The resulting point cloud will be stored in the reconstruction.ply file in the opensfm directory. You can view the point cloud using a tool such as CloudCompare or MeshLab.

Note that the above commands assume that the images are stored in a single directory. If your images are stored in multiple directories, you'll need to modify the command accordingly. Also, the commands assume that you're running OpenSfM from the command line. If you're using the Python API, you'll need to use the appropriate functions to execute the steps.
